					<p>The library is a full partnerin the educational mission of the institution. As modes of information availability and delivery evolve, the library provides access to these through on-site and remote collections. The library's instructional activities include greater collaboration with acadenmic departments to integrate information resources directly into the learning process.</p>
	
	<p>This vision will require intensified sharing of print resources, databases, and technology with cooperation and partnerships among libraries, publishersand users. Library personnel will offer flexible responses to the rapid and dramatic changes in patterns of information access. Library facilities will be expanded and upgraded to provide space and equipment for efficient access to all information resources, regardless of location.</p>
